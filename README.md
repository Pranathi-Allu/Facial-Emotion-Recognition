# Facial-Emotion-Recognition
This project detects and classifies human emotions from facial expressions in images and videos using deep learning techniques. Leveraging convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and facial landmark-based preprocessing, it identifies emotions such as happy, sad, neutral, angry, surprised, and more in real time.
